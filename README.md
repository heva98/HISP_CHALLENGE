# HISP_CHALLENGE
My solution to a teaser is designed to assess my individual skills and abilities as a software developer.
The goal of the task is to create a functional To-do application that allows users to manage their tasks and track their progress. The application should allow users to:

●	Add new To-do item.
●	View the To-do list.
●	Updated a To-do item.
●	Change the status of a To-do item.
●	Delete a To-do item.
